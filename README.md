## 🧭 Project Overview
This project explores how **machine learning algorithms** can be integrated with **cloud-based data warehousing systems** to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.  

As data volumes continue to grow exponentially, traditional on-premises data warehouses struggle with high resource demands and limited flexibility.  
By leveraging **machine learning in cloud environments**, organizations can optimize:
- Query processing speed  
- Data loading efficiency  
- Resource utilization  
- Cost management  

The study investigates **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **reinforcement learning** techniques and their roles in **automating, predicting, and optimizing** data warehouse operations.
